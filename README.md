GitHub Pages example

## About
This is an example of a *project specific* [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) page using [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).

The example uses the default Jekyll setup that as described in the [Jekyll quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

## Config

### Gemfile
Don't forget to update your Gemfile. If you are not sure what that means, open up your `Gemfile` and read the comments!

> Getting the error below after making changes to your Gemfile?
```
Running `bundle update` will rebuild your snapshot from scratch, using only
the gems in your Gemfile, which may resolve the conflict.
```
> Run `bundle update`

### _config.yml
Don't forget to update Jekyll's config file. You can update information such as the site's title, your email, twitter username and github username in `_config.yml`. This is also where you can change what theme Jekyll tries to load.

## Deployment

Once your website is ready for deployment, visit the [GitHub pages manual](https://pages.github.com/) again for instructions on deploying your page.

> Be sure to click the "Project site" button! (Under the video instructions).

> Be sure to click the "Start from scratch" button! (Under the "Project site" button).

### Page file locations
In this example, all Jekyll files were put into the repository root, in the master branch.
